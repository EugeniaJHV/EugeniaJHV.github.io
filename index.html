    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>Right now, I'm very interested in robotics, though I can't narrow down a particular niche yet. I work with Ryan St. Pierre and Nick Brown on Microrobotics, but I'm always interested in different robotics projects.<br>
        I'm also interested in FPGA development, specifically the tooling behind XADCs and sEL4 software.
