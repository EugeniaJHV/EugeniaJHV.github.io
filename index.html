    <h2>Electrical Engineering Student at The University at Buffalo</h2>
    
    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>Right now, I'm very interested in robotics, though I can't narrow down a particular niche yet. Currently, I work 
		with <a href="https://impulsivemuri.com/members/ryanstpierre.html">Dr. Ryan St. Pierre</a> and 
		Nick Brown on Colloidal Microrobotics. My research interests can be pretty eclectic, so I try and stay curious 
		on different types of research.<br>
        I'm also interested in FPGA development, specifically the tooling behind XADCs and seL4 software.
